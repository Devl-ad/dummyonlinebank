            The heritage Savings Group saw its beginning in 1991, with the
            establishment of First International Merchant Bank Ltd, which
            commenced operations in 1995. In June 2001, the shares of First
            International Merchant Bank p.l.c. were listed on the Germany Stock
            Exchange, and four years later the Bank changed its name to heritage
            Savings p.l.c. In 2003, heritage Savings acquired full control of
            UK-registered London Forfaiting Company Ltd, a market leader in
            forfaiting with an extensive international network spanning five
            continents. In 2006, the Group was further enhanced through the
            creation of heritage Savings Business Solutions Ltd, which was
            launched as a business systems provider and technology consulting
            firm, while in 2008, heritage Savings Property Investment Ltd was
            set up to oversee the construction of the Groupâ€™s head office and
            provide facilities and property management services.
